# BlogCraft MVP - Next Steps & Development Tasks

**Project:** BlogCraft MVP
**Date:** May 13, 2025
**Context:** Initial MVP features (Idea Generation, Drafting, Basic SEO Suggestions, Export) have been built. This document outlines tasks for testing, refinement, initial marketing, and planning future development.

**Overarching Goal for This Phase:** Validate the MVP with real users, gather feedback, make essential refinements, launch an initial marketing presence, and strategically plan the next set of valuable features.

---

## Phase A: MVP Testing & User Feedback (High Priority - Immediate Focus)

- [ ] **Internal Testing & Quality Assurance (QA):**
    - [ ] Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of all existing MVP features (Idea Gen, Draft, SEO Suggest, Export).
    - [ ] Test with diverse keyword inputs and scenarios.
    - [ ] Identify and document all bugs, UI glitches, and areas of unexpected AI behavior.
    - [ ] Evaluate the quality and relevance of AI-generated ideas, drafts, and SEO suggestions.
    - [ ] Test export functionality for .txt and .html across different browsers/OS.
- [ ] **Beta Tester Recruitment:**
    - [ ] Define criteria for ideal beta testers (e.g., bloggers, content marketers, SMB owners).
    - [ ] Recruit a small group of 5-10 beta testers.
    - [ ] Prepare a clear onboarding guide or instructions for beta testers.
- [ ] **Beta Testing Program Execution:**
    - [ ] Provide beta testers with access to the MVP.
    - [ ] Assign specific tasks or scenarios for them to complete.
    - [ ] Set up channels for feedback collection (e.g., survey forms, dedicated email, Discord/Slack channel).
- [ ] **Feedback Collection & Analysis:**
    - [ ] Create a structured survey (e.g., Google Forms, Typeform) covering:
        - [ ] Usability & Ease of Use
        - [ ] Quality of AI Outputs (Ideas, Draft, SEO)
        - [ ] Workflow & User Journey
        - [ ] Bugs Encountered
        - [ ] Most Valuable Feature(s)
        - [ ] Missing Feature(s) / Wishlist
    - [ ] Conduct 1-on-1 interviews with a subset of beta testers for deeper insights, if possible.
    - [ ] Consolidate and analyze all feedback to identify common themes, critical issues, and popular requests.

## Phase B: MVP Refinement & Iteration (Based on Feedback from Phase A)

- [ ] **Bug Fixing:**
    - [ ] Prioritize and fix critical bugs identified during internal QA and beta testing.
- [ ] **Usability Enhancements (UI/UX):**
    - [ ] Implement improvements based on user feedback regarding workflow, clarity, and ease of use.
    - [ ] Add loading indicators for AI generation steps if not already present.
    - [ ] Improve error message clarity.
- [ ] **AI Output Quality Tuning:**
    - [ ] Review and refine prompts used in Langchain/LangGraph for idea generation, drafting, and SEO suggestions based on feedback.
    - [ ] Experiment with OpenAI model parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p) for better balance of creativity and coherence if needed.
    - [ ] Consider A/B testing different prompts or model settings if feasible.
- [ ] **Editor Improvements (if applicable):**
    - [ ] If current draft display is basic, evaluate feasibility of integrating a simple client-side rich text editor (e.g., TinyMCE, Quill.js basic setup) for pre-export formatting based on user demand.
- [ ] **Export Functionality Refinements:**
    - [ ] Consider adding Markdown (`.md`) export if frequently requested.
    - [ ] Ensure exported HTML is clean and well-structured.

## Phase C: Marketing & Initial User Acquisition (Concurrent with A & B)

- [ ] **Landing Page Development/Finalization:**
    - [ ] Develop/refine landing page content based on the previously generated prompt (or your own copy).
    - [ ] Incorporate screenshots of the MVP.
    * [ ] Ensure a clear Call to Action (e.g., Try MVP, Join Beta, Sign up for Waitlist).
    - [ ] Implement basic analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to track visitors.
- [ ] **Initial Blog Content Creation (for marketing BlogCraft):**
    * [ ] Write 2-3 initial blog posts based on the content strategy and ideas from the previously generated prompt. Topics could include:
        * Introducing BlogCraft MVP.
        * How AI (and BlogCraft) helps overcome writer's block.
        * Kickstarting SEO with BlogCraft.
    - [ ] Incorporate MVP screenshots into blog posts.
    - [ ] Publish posts on your chosen platform (e.g., a simple blog integrated with your site).
- [ ] **Initial Promotion:**
    - [ ] Share landing page and blog content on relevant social media channels (LinkedIn, Twitter, relevant Facebook groups, Indie Hackers, etc.).
    - [ ] Reach out to your network for initial visibility and beta testers.

## Phase D: Strategic New Feature Development Planning (Post-MVP Refinement)

*This phase involves *planning and prioritizing* the next set of features based on initial MVP feedback and strategic goals. Actual development will follow.*

- [ ] **Evaluate & Prioritize Feature Backlog (based on Phase A feedback & strategic goals):**
    - [ ] **User Accounts & Saved Work:** (High potential impact for retention)
        - [ ] Plan database schema.
        - [ ] Plan authentication flow.
    - [ ] **Improved SEO Agent:**
        - [ ] Research options for readability scores.
        - [ ] Explore adding keyword density checks or NLP term suggestions (lite version).
    - [ ] **Direct Publishing Integration (e.g., WordPress):**
        - [ ] Research WordPress REST API / XML-RPC.
        - [ ] Plan OAuth or API key flow for user authorization.
    - [ ] **Content Style/Tone Selection:**
        - [ ] Plan how to modify Langchain prompts based on user selection.

**Notes:**
* This is a living document. Adjust tasks and priorities as you gather more information and user feedback.
* Don't try to do everything at once. Focus and iterate.
* Remember the importance of the "human touch" in AI-assisted content, and ensure BlogCraft encourages this.
